/*
- "# include" is an instructive to import input output stream from the standard library.
- "int" indicates that the last line of code within {} will return an integer value.
- Inside () are arguments which can be specified by the user.
- Code in {} is what we want the computer to execute.
- "\n" creates a new line.
- C++ ignores all white space; it is merely stylistic practice to indent the content of {}.
- .cpp is just a choice, can use any extension
- "std::cout" means look in the standard namespace for cout
